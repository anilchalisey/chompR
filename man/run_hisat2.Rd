\usage{
run_hisat2(hisat2 = "hisat2", idx = NULL, mate1 = NULL,
  mate2 = NULL, fastq = TRUE, fasta = FALSE,
  softClipPenalty = NULL, noSoftClip = FALSE, noSplice = FALSE,
  knownSplice = NULL, strand = NULL, tmo = FALSE, maxAlign = NULL,

  quiet = FALSE, non_deterministic = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{hisat2}{Path to hisat2 (if using WSL, then this should be the
full path on the linux subsystem)}

\item{idx}{The basename of the index for the reference genome. The basename
is the name of any of the index files up to but not including the final
.1.ht2, etc.}

\item{mate1}{Comma-separated list of files containing mate 1s (filename
usually includes _1)}

\item{mate2}{Comma-separated list of files containing mate 2s (filename
usually includes _2). Sequences specified with this option must correspond
file-for-file and read-for-read with those specified in .}

\item{fastq}{Logical indicating if reads are FASTQ files.}

\item{fasta}{Logical indicating if reads are FASTA files.}

\item{softClipPenalty}{Sets the maximum (MX) and minimum (MN) penalties for
soft-clipping per base, both integers.  Must be given in the format "MX,MN".}

\item{noSoftClip}{Logical indicating whether to disallow soft-clipping.}

\item{noSplice}{Logical indicating whether to switch off spliced alignment,
e.g., for DNA-seq analysis.}

\item{knownSplice}{Path to text file containing known splice sites.}

\item{strand}{Specify strand-specific information.  Default is unstranded.}

\item{tmo}{Logical indicating whether to report only those reads aligning to
known transcripts.}

\item{maxAlign}{Integer indicating the maximum number of distinct primary
alignments to search for each read.}

\item{secondary}{Logical indicating whether to report secondary alignments.}

\item{minInsert}{The minimum fragment length for valid paired-end alignments.
This option is valid only with noSplice = TRUE.}

\item{maxInsert}{The maximum fragment length for valid paired-end alignments.
This option is valid only with noSplice = TRUE.}

\item{nomixed}{By default, when hisat2 cannot find a concordant or discordant
alignment for a pair, it then tries to find alignments for the individual
mates. If TRUE, this option disables that behavior.}

\item{nodiscordant}{By default, hisat2 looks for discordant alignments if it
cannot find any concordant alignments.  If true, this option disables that
behavior.}

\item{threads}{an integer value indicating the number of workers to be used. If NULL then one less than the
maximum number of cores will be used. [DEFAULT = NULL].}

\item{rgid}{Character string, to which the read group ID is set.}

\item{quiet}{If TRUE, print nothing except alignments and serious errors.}

\item{non_deterministic}{When set to TRUE, HISAT2 re-initializes its
pseudo-random generator for each read using the current time.}
}
\value{
Alignment file in SAM format
}
\description{
Script to align reads to a reference genome using hisat2.  This
  requires an existing index which may be created using hisat2 itself.
  Commonly used genome indices may also be downloaded from the HISAT2
  homepage.
